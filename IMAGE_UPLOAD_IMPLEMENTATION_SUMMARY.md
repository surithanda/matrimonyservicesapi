# Image Upload API Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive image upload API for the matrimony services application. The API supports three types of images as shown in the reference UI: **Profile Picture**, **Cover Photo**, and **Individual Pictures**. The implementation uses email addresses as the primary identifier for storing and retrieving images.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Database Integration**
- Added `user_images` table to store image metadata
- Supports email-based image management
- Tracks image type, file information, and active status
- Includes proper indexing for performance

### 2. **File Upload System**
- Uses **Multer** middleware for handling multipart/form-data
- Automatic file organization by image type:
  - `./uploads/profile-pictures/`
  - `./uploads/cover-photos/`
  - `./uploads/individual-pictures/`
- Unique filename generation using UUID and timestamps
- File size limit of 5MB per image
- Image file validation (JPEG, PNG, etc.)

### 3. **Business Logic**
- **Profile Picture**: Only one active per user (previous ones auto-deactivated)
- **Cover Photo**: Only one active per user (previous ones auto-deactivated)
- **Individual Pictures**: Multiple images allowed per user
- Email-based access control and management

### 4. **Security Features**
- JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- Email validation and format checking
- File type validation (images only)
- User-specific access control

## API Endpoints Created

### Core Upload API
```
POST /api/images/upload
```
- Accepts multipart/form-data with image file
- Requires: `image` (file), `email` (string), `image_type` (enum)
- Returns: Upload confirmation with image metadata

### Image Retrieval APIs
```
GET /api/images/user/:email
GET /api/images/user/:email?image_type=profile_picture
GET /api/images/user/:email?image_type=cover_photo
GET /api/images/user/:email?image_type=individual_picture
```
- Returns grouped images by type
- Supports filtering by image type
- Includes complete metadata

### Image Management
```
DELETE /api/images/:imageId
GET /api/images/file/:filename
```
- Soft delete functionality (sets is_active=false)
- Direct file serving with type-based path resolution
- Static file access via `/uploads/*` routes

## File Structure Created

```
matrimonyservicesapi/
├── routes/
│   └── images.js                    # New image routes
├── uploads/                         # Auto-created directories

├── IMAGE_UPLOAD_API_DOCUMENTATION.md
└── IMAGE_UPLOAD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
```

## Database Schema Added

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_images (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  image_type ENUM('profile_picture', 'cover_photo', 'individual_picture') NOT NULL,
  filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  original_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  file_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
  file_size INT,
  mime_type VARCHAR(100),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  INDEX idx_email (email),
  INDEX idx_image_type (image_type),
  INDEX idx_email_type (email, image_type)
);
```

## Postman Collection Updates

Added comprehensive **"Image Management"** folder with:

### Upload Tests
- Upload Profile Picture
- Upload Cover Photo  
- Upload Individual Picture
- Automatic test scripts for validation

### Retrieval Tests
- Get All User Images
- Get Profile Pictures Only
- Get Cover Photos Only
- Get Individual Pictures Only

### Management Tests
- Delete Image
- Serve Image File
- Static Image Access

### Environment Variables
- `uploaded_image_id`: Stores uploaded image ID
- `uploaded_filename`: Stores uploaded filename
- `auth_token`: JWT authentication token

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "multer": "^1.4.x",
  "uuid": "^9.0.x"
}
```

## Image Size Recommendations (from UI Reference)

- **Profile Picture**: 265x265 pixels (square format)
- **Cover Photo**: 520x192 pixels (banner format)
- **Individual Pictures**: Flexible sizing for gallery

## Usage Example

### Upload Profile Picture
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/api/images/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token" \
  -F "image=@profile.jpg" \
  -F "email=user@example.com" \
  -F "image_type=profile_picture"
```

### Response
```json
{
  "message": "Image uploaded successfully",
  "image": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "image_type": "profile_picture",
    "filename": "image-1640995200000-abc123.jpg",
    "original_name": "profile.jpg",
    "file_size": 245760,
    "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
    "upload_path": "./uploads/profile-pictures/image-1640995200000-abc123.jpg"
  }
}
```

### Retrieve User Images
```bash
curl -X GET \
  "http://localhost:8080/api/images/user/user@example.com" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token"
```

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Authentication failures (401)
- Validation errors (400)
- File upload errors (400)
- Database errors (500)
- File not found (404)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Multer Configuration
- **Storage**: Disk storage with organized directories
- **Filename**: UUID-based unique naming
- **Filter**: Image files only
- **Limits**: 5MB maximum file size

### Authentication Integration
- Uses existing JWT middleware (`authenticateToken`)
- All endpoints require valid authentication
- User-specific access control

### Database Integration
- Uses existing MySQL connection from `config/database.js`
- Follows existing query patterns and error handling
- Includes proper transaction handling for updates

## Testing Strategy

The Postman collection includes:
- Automated test scripts for success scenarios
- Error condition validation
- Environment variable management
- Response validation

## Future Enhancements Possible

1. **Image Processing**: Add thumbnail generation
2. **Cloud Storage**: Integrate with AWS S3 or similar
3. **Image Optimization**: Automatic compression and resizing
4. **Batch Upload**: Multiple images in single request
5. **Image Analytics**: Track view counts and usage

## Deployment Considerations

1. **File Permissions**: Ensure upload directories are writable
2. **Disk Space**: Monitor storage usage for uploaded files
3. **Backup Strategy**: Include uploaded files in backup procedures
4. **Security**: Consider additional file scanning for malicious content

## Compatibility

The implementation is fully compatible with:
- Existing authentication system
- Current database schema
- Existing API patterns
- Frontend integration requirements

The API is now ready for frontend integration and supports the image upload workflow shown in the reference UI.
